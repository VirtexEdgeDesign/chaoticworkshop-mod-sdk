The Chaotic Workshop Mod kit provides an SDK to code and create your own Items and Levels for the use in Chaotic Workshop. The game uses the Farseer Physics Library (https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=farseerphysics) to create a physics sandbox. With a multitude of examples for Farseer, it's incredibly easy to get started today creating your own custom sandbox!
